# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA and XGBoost

In this notebook, we have walked through the process of building an ARIMA model for time series forecasting. We began by examining the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to identify the potential order of the ARIMA model. Based on our observations, we hypothesized an ARIMA(2,1,4) model. We then fitted this model to our training data to capture the underlying patterns in the electricity demand, as represented by the 'PJME_MW' time series.

## Stationarity and Model Fitting
Before fitting the model, we ensured that our time series was stationary, a critical assumption in ARIMA modeling. After confirming stationarity and fitting the model, we evaluated the model's residuals to ensure they behaved like white noise â€” an indication that the model has captured the underlying process effectively.

## Model Diagnostics
The residual diagnostics showed that while there was no autocorrelation left in the residuals, indicating that the model terms are adequate, the distribution of the residuals was not perfectly normal, suggesting potential room for improvement.

## Forecasting
Using our fitted ARIMA model, we proceeded to forecast future values for the year 2018. We visualized the forecast alongside our training data and actual observations for comparison.

## Results and Visualization
The forecasted values from the ARIMA model are plotted and compared with the actual data. This visualization helps us in assessing the performance of our model. From our initial assessment, the model seems to capture the overall trend in the data. However, evaluating the forecast against actual data using performance metrics such as MAE and RMSE would give us a quantitative measure of the model's accuracy.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
While the model has done a reasonably good job at forecasting the electricity demand, there are discrepancies that could be addressed through model refinement. In future iterations, we could:

- Explore more sophisticated models such as SARIMA or SARIMAX if seasonality or exogenous variables are present.
- Perform a more exhaustive hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal order of differencing, autoregression, and moving average components.
- Apply different transformations or anomaly detection methods to handle outliers and non-normal distributions more effectively.

Our journey through time series analysis demonstrates the iterative nature of the modeling process, where diagnostics and performance evaluation inform subsequent rounds of model refinement.
